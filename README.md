# CorefChallenge
This is our winning submission for the Kingland Machine Learning Competition 2019.

The competition is focused on a solution for anaphora in linguistics. Anaphora represents a challenge for natural language processing (NLP) and named entity recognition (NER) concepts in computational linguistics, and since Kinglandâ€™s Cognitive/AI solutions are centered around successful usage of NLP and NER within the field of Text Analytics, having a solution for anaphora is important.
